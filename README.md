Clone the repo locally. 
Open the generate_images.py file and feel free to change the `twoPowers` param to update the number of images being generated. Uncomment the type of image that you want to be generated (`horizontalStripeData`, `verticalStripeData`, `checkeredData`, or `xdata`). Then run `make`. The images you have generated will be placed in the image folder inside this repo, so feel then `mv images <your image folder>`.
