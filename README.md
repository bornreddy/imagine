Generate Images!
====

This is a simple utility to generate images for us in computer vision projects. 

How to Use It.
====
Clone the repo into the directory you wish to generate your images in, construct a folder called images to hold the output. 
Feel free to change the `twoPowers` param to update the number of images being generated. Uncomment the type of image that you want to be generated (`horizontalStripeData`, `verticalStripeData`, `checkeredData`, or `xdata`). Then run `make`.
